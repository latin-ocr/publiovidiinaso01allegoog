[Decimum the daughters oi Pelias, Jason’s enemy, by a
similar -miracle wrought upon an aged ram, Medea brings about
their father⁷s 'death (V 11. 29'7-349). Escaping by means of winged
dragous, and passing over tile scene oi many transformatione,
Medea comes to Athens3 whence (her attempted poisoning oi
Theseus being foiled by the⁴ recognition oi his father AEgeus) she
suddenly vanishes (350-424). A feast is celebrated in honor uf
Theseus’ exploits ; and hostility ensuin'g with Minos (Europa's son)

660). Now Cephalus had received from his wife Procris a hound
and a dart that never missed its aim; and, as he deligh ted greatly

, in hunting‚ Procris being je'alous watched him from a thicket; and

he, taking rt sor the muuement ossome wald creature, shot her with
that dart which was heroum gift (δότ-865.) Minos, making war
on Athens to avenge the slaying of his son Androgeos, comes first
to Megara, where Scylla, daughter os the king Nisus, out of love
