[Auouu the creatures generated 'from the soil of the earth aflet
the Deluge, had been the serpent Python, slain by Apollo, who
thereon instituted the Pythian games: the prize of victory, first
the oak-leaf, was afterwards the laurei, sacred to Apollo, being the
nymph Daphne, loved by him, and changed to that form to escape
his pursuit.— lo, daughter of the river-god Inachus, beloved by
Jupiter, is changed into a heifer by him, to escape the jealousy of
Juno; but is put by her in charge of Argus of the hundred eyes,
who being soothed to sleep by Mercury-who sings the 'story of
Syrinx converted to a water-reed to avoid the pursuitof Pan-is
slain by him, and his hundred eyes are setin the peacock’s tail.
10, fleeing to Egypt, becomes the goddess Isis, and the mother of
Epaphus ; who denies against Phaethon his boast to be son of the
San-god, as avouched by his mother Clymene (Ι. 416-779).]

*The palace of the Sun described (Ila-18). Phoebus, the god of
Day, receives Phaethon with affection, and owns him as his son,
promising by oath to give him whatever boon he should desire
(19-46). Phaethon demands the charge of the chariot and horses of
the Sun for a single day, persisting in spite of his father's naming
and appeal (47-102). He mounts, and attempts the¹ celestini way:
dread forms of the Zodiac: the steeds dash wildly from the path
(ως-205). Terror and devastation caused by the fiery chariot:
blasting of mountains and rivers, ‘and alarm of Neptune himself ;
Earth appeals to Jupiter, who blasts Phaethon with a thunderbolt
(206-324). His sistens are converted to poplars, and their tears
to amber (325-366); while his kinsman Cygnus, bewailing the
calamity‚ becomes a Swau (367-380). Τὴς Sun, in grief and wrath,
hides his head from the -earth; but, entreated by the gods and
commanded by Jupiter, collects again his scattered steeds, to
resume their wanted cou'rse (381-400). ’ ’
