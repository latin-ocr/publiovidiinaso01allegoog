[Tun doom os Niobe reminds one hearer of the vengeance
inflicted on certain people os Lycia, who, having refused to Latona
a draught of water from the lake in her extreme thirst, were by
Jupiter turned into frogs (Vl. 313-381) 3 and another of the satyr
Marsyas, who was conquered in music and flayed by Apollo; and
another oi the crime oi Tantalus, Niobe's bathen, who caused his
son Pelops to be served up at meat to the gods (382-411). Pan·
dion of Athens, attached sor refusing the friendship ol Pelops, is
helped by Tereus, king of Thrace, to whom he gives his daughter
Progne to wife. But Tereus, having¹ committed incest with
Progne’s sister Philomel‚ is dreadfully revenged by the two, who
serve to himin a banquet the body ot' his son Itys; and, pursuing
thern for vengeance, all are transformed to birds -Tereus becom-
Δ iuga hoopoii, Progne a swallow, Philomel a nightingale, and itys

apheasant ς while Pandion, dying of ngef, is succeeded by Erec-
·theus (412-676), whose daughter Orithyia is borne away by Boreas
(the North Wind) to Thrace. Here she becomes mother of the
winged heroes Zethes and Calais, who accompany Jason and the
Argonauts in their voyage for the Golden Fleece (677—721).]
Arrived at Colchis, ,lason is met by the enchantress Medea,
daughter of king A'etes3 who, moved by love, secures him by her
enchantments from the Dragon guarding the fleece‚ and from the
lire-breathing bulis, with which he· ploughs the appointed field,
sowing it with serpents’ teeth (V ΙΙ. 1-122). From these spring up
armed men, who prepare to attack Jason; but he, instructed by ·
Medea, casts a stone among them, whereat they perish in mutual
slaughter (123-143). Returning to lolchos with Medea, he en-

* treats ber to restore to youth his aged father. The magic is
, described at length, by which she prepares the juices of miraculous

herbs; and, these proving efficacious, AEson is converted to the
fresh vigor of forty years before (144-293).
