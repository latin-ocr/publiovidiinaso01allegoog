[Orthe family of Cadmus, Actaeon, having beheld Diana as
she was bathing with her nymphs, was changed by her rnto a stag,
aud‘lbffim pieces by his own hounds (ΙΙΙ. 138-252). Semele
became the mother of Bacchus, but was destroyed hythe presence
of Jupiter, w'hom she desired to see clothed with dames and thunder
(253- 315). Tiresias, the Thebae seer, is made blind,¹ but endowed
with prophecy (316-338). The nymph Echo, pining with love of
Narcissus, becomes a roek, her voice alone surviving (339-4or);

nities, and caused him to be seized‚' 1s torn m pieces by Bacchanals,

Δ his mother and sisters aiding: Bacchus meanwhile (in the fbrr‘n' of

Acaetes) relates the miracle wrought by himself upon a Tyrrhenian
crew, whose ship's tackle he had converted to serpente, and them-
selves to'dolphins (511-733). Three Theben sisters (Minyeides)
likewise refrain from the rites of Bacchus: of whom one relates the
tale of Pyramus and Thisbe (IV. 1-54)].

These young lovers, dwelling in Babylon, had appointed a
meeting at the tomb of king Ninus (55-92). Thisbe, coming
first, is terrified by a lion and so escapes. Pyramus, soon arriving,
finds tracks of the beast and the torn mantle of Thisbe ; and con-
ceiving that she is slain, stabs himself with his sword, his blood
reddening the fruit of the mulberry, at whose foot he lies (93- 127)

' Thisbe, soon returning, finds him dying, and slays herself with the
sword yet warm (128- 166).
