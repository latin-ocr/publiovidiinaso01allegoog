[Hortenses returning from the Calydonian Huot, is entertained .

with his friends by the river-god Achelous, who recounts the fate of
certain nymphe, turned into rocks aad islanda. These prodigies
are mocked by Pirithous, son of Ixion, who is among thern. To
silence his cavil, Lelex relates the following tale (589619).]

Jupiter and Mercury, journeying once in Phrygia, were refused
hospitality by all the inhabitants of a‘ certain place, except two
pious rustics, Philemon and his wife Baucis, who provide such
entertainment as they* are able (διο-688). While the inhospitable
town was drowned in a marsh, the poor hut of Philemon became
a temple, of which he aud his wife were made attendants ; until in
agood old age they were both transformed to trees, he ιο an oak
aud she to a liodeu <689-724).

ILIAE con'iermina quereus
collibus est Phrygiis, modico circumdata muro.
haud procul huic Itstagnum est, tellus habitabilis olim,
nunc celebres mergis fulicisque palustribus undae. 625
Juppiter huc specie mortali, cumque parente
venit Atlantiades, positis caducifer alis.

mille domos adiere, locum requiemque petentes·

y mille domos clausere serae Tamen una recepit,
parva quidem, stipulis et canna tecta palustri. ⁶³0
sed' pra Baucis alius parilique aetate Philemon
illa sunt annis juncti juvenilibus, illa
consenuere casa; paupertatemque fatendo
effecere levem, nec iniqua mente ferendo.
nec refert, dominos illic, famulosne requiras: ⁶35
tota domus duo sunt, idern parentque jubentque.

7Ergo ubi caelicolae parvos tetigere penates,
submissoque humiles rutrarunt vertice postes,
membra senex posito jussit relevare sedili,
