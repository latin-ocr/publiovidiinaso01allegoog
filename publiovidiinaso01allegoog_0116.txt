W1rwnnaww apart from the love of women, and having
gathered by his song a grove of forest trees [among them the piae
which was once the youth Attis, and Cyparissus changed by Apollo
into a Cypress]‚ Orpheus sings of the loves of the gods for mortal
men And first of Ganymede of Troy, borne to heaven by Jupiter
in the form of an eagle (143-161) ; and of Hyacinthus, abeautiful
youth of Sparta, beloved by Apollo, but accidentally killed by him
with a discus (or quoit) that he had hurled into the air3 from

’ whose blood sprang the flower that bears bis name(162-219).

[He further sings of certain people of Cyprus, cruel to
strangers, who by Venus were changed to oxen (zan-237); of the
statue wrought by Pygmalion, which became aliving maiden, and
his bride (243-297) ; of Myrrha, who because of her incestuons love
of ber father became a trse weeping fragrant gum (298-502); of her
child Adonis, loved by Venus ( 503-5 59) ς of Atalanta, fleet of foot,
who was won in the race by craft of Hippomanes with three golden
apples, bnt both were afterwards changed into lions (560-707);
and of the death of Adonis, slain by a wild boar, and by Venus
converted into the flower Anemone, as Menthe had aforetime been

by Proserpine into the herb Mint (708-739).]

COLLIS erat, collemque super planissima campi

umbra loco dedratr qua postquam parte resedit

dis genitus vates et fila sonantia movit,

umbra loco venit. Non Chaonis afuitarbor, 9⁰

non nemus Heliadum, non frondibus aesculus altis,
