Tne word sastt‘, properly applied to those days oi the year on
which rt was permitted (sas) to transact public business, came to
be applied to the Roman Calendar, or systematic arrangement
and classification of th'e days oi each month. Ovid's purpose in
this poem was to caet this calendar· into a poetic form, describ
ing whatever was penuliar and characteristie' tn the Roman usages,
-as festivals and ritem-and working into it whatever traditions
and myths were current among the people. The Roman religion
was so 'meagre in the elementa οἰ iable, 'th'at its mythology, as pre·
sented in this worlr, is hardly more than a clumsy adaptation and
vamping over of Grecian urytns tt was, however, as rich in
form and ceremonial, as tt was poor in story; and the most valu-
able and original portions of the Fasti are those which describe
fragments os these primitive rites, which had managed to survive
the inroad of the· more sashionable Greek and Oriental forms of
worship, <and still. lingered in the community.¹ Some of them,
indeed, held their own fot centuries longer, and sorquere
transformed and adopted into the Christian calendar , .

Only six books of the Fasti, containing the months from Jan·
uary to June inclusive, are cirtant. it rs a much disputed question
whether the olher six books have been lost, or were never written}
lt' rs probable than they werewritten' tn the rougb, vbut unfinished
at the time oi the poet's exile, and never publisbed. At any rate, ·
there are no citations' ιιι ancient authors from any but the first
six books

The following extracts from the fourth book (April) contain a
description of two ver'y ancient festivals, with the traditional
account of the founding ol Rome, introduced in the usual manner
nithe poet.
