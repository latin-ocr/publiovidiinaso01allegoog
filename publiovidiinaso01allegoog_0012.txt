the emperor at some weakness‚ lolly, or fault, which he says
he is not free to tell. Some have thought he was indiscreet
enough to make love to Iulia, the brilliant, witty, and erratio

· daughter of the'emperor, wife oi the grave²Agrippa5 others

that he unfortunately knew too much of some court scandal,
probably connected with Julia or her ill-iamed and ill-fated
daughter, others that Augustus, as public patron of morals,
took offence at the somewhat cynical indecorum of certain
oi his poems. At any rate, the emperor was hardened
against all his flatteries and prayers, and aiter an, exile of
about ten years he died at Tomi, m· n. 18.

Besides the poenis represented in this volume, Ovid was
the author oi the Ars Amatoria and the Remedium Amoris
(to which reference has just been made), and of numerous
“Elegies,” including four books oi letters written in exile
(Ex Ponto Libri iv.). As a poet, his fame is far below that
oi Virgil and Horace, - deservedly, since his loose and easy
verse bears no comparison with· theelaborate finish of theirs.
For lancy and fine poetic feeling, however, many of the
Elegies - both in the Trr'stia and the Amores- show avein
of as good quality as either ol his rivals3 while in absolute

Δ ease ol handling the artificial structure of Latin verse it may

be doubted whether he has ever had an equal. His chief
merit, however, is as an excellent story-teller,-smooth,
facile, fluent, sometimes, it must be confessed, inordinately
diffuse. As the most celebrated existing collection of the
most famous fables oi the ancient world, the Metamorphoses,
in particular, makes the best of introductions to the noblet
'and more difficult verse of Virgil. ·
