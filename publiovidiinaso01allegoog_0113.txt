Χ. 7.] Orpheus and Eurydice.

XIV. Onrunus aun Euuvmcp.
[Boou X.-r-77.]

[Ascraeum mother of Hercules, to entertain lole (who had
married his son Hyllus), relates the tale os Hercules' birth. which
was long delayed‚ but at last brought about by the artifice os Galan-

'. this, a waiting maid3 who, lor the falsehood she told, was turned

into-a weasel by Ilithyia‚ whom she had deceived (lX. 273-323l
lole relates in turn of her sister Dryope, changed to a lotus
(324-339). The restoring of Iolaus to youth, and the miraculous
manhood bestowed on the children ot' Callirhoe having moved the
displeasure of some ol the gods, Jupiter reminds them of the pain·
iul old age of his own son Minos (φο-442). The tale is told of
Byblis, daughter ol Miletus (who had migrated from Crete to Asia):
she, filled with a guilty love sor her brother Caunus, became a foun-
tain in Caria (443-665). Iphis, daughter of Ligdus of Crete, having
been brought up as a youth to avoid her sather's displeasure that a
daughter was born to him, was at length changed to a young man
by Isis, and so became the husband of 'Ianthe (666-797).]

Hymen, proceeding to Thrace, aster the marriage os lphis,
unites Orpheus to Eurydice, but not happily, for she died srom the
bite of a serpent. To recover her, Orpheus penetrated the sbadows
of the lower World, where even the Furies are moved to tears at
song, the torments ‚oi bellare stayed, and Proserpine is won to
yield him back his wife, only on condition that he shall not look
behind him till again in the upper world. Turning about too soon,
in his eagerness to see her, he loses her again, and is not suffered
asecond time to enter Hades (X. 1-77).

INDE per immensum croceo velatus amictu
aethera digreditur, Ciconumque Hymenaeus ad
oras

ἶ tendit, et Orphea nequiquam voce vocatur,
’ adfuit ille quideme sed nec sollemnia verba,

nec laetos vultus, nec felix attulit omen. ς
sax quoque, quam tenuit, lacrimoso stridula sumo
usque fuit, nullosque invenit motibus ignes.
