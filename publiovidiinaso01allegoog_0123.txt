XVII. Tun Snoar or Munus.
[Boou X1··-85-19s]

Phocennmn from Thrace into Phrygia, Bacchus is deserted by
Silenus, whom king Midas restores to him, and so receives from
Bacchus whatever boon he should desire. Choosing that whatever
he touched might become gold, Midas presently finds his gitta
curse; but by help of the god is freed from it on bathing in the
river Pactolus, whose sauds thencesorth become gold (85-145).
Alterwards‚ frequenting woods and lonely places, he became
witness ol a contest sor the palm of music between Pan and
Apollo. By Tmolus, tlie mountain-god, Apollo is judged victor3
and Midas pronouncing sor Pan, his ,ears are by Apollo lengthened
into ass’s ears (146-179); the secretos which being by his servant
whispered to the earth, there sprang up reeds‚ which in their
rustling told the shame of Midas (180-193).
