all cases where there are words ofsmore than two syllables; for
thus a short syllable will often serve as a key to the entire structure
of the verse.

For examples, we will take the first four lines of the poem.

1. In novofert dnrneut- enutritas dicere formas.

Here the last three words ¹are scanned exactly as they read:
multatas Ι dicere Ι formas. Of the others, Animus shows by its
necent that the i of the penult is short; and, as its last syllable
must belong to the following word, nothing more is needed to show
that the verse will scan as followsz- -. ¹ ι
ln nova Ι fert dnllmus ΙΙ multatas Ι dIcere Ι formas ς’
and the quantity of the other syllables is shown at once by their
position in the verse. .

2. Corpora: Di, creptis—nam vos mutastis et illas- Ι
The first word corporo, being a dactyl. at once gives a correct start to
the verse. The second foot, Di coep-—is equally plain, as a spondee;
and after this beginning, the rest of the yersescans of itself : -

Corpora: Ι Di, coepitis ΙΙ -nam Ι vos multastls et Ι illas.
3. Adspznore meis,· prioraque ab origine munuli.
The first word, adspiratio, is nearly as clear, as, when we remember
either the pronunciatien of adspira or the quantity of the o of the
first conjugation, we see thatgit contains three long ,syllableea
spondee and the beginning of a dactyl. The last three feet⁴ are
pronounced exactiy as in prose (observing the elision) ι -
Adspibate melis3 ΙΙ priimaqu’ ab dlriglne Ι mundi.

4 Ad meaperpltuum dednerietlmporacarmen. . .
Here the three last words forma perfect metrical series ; and the
only difficulty in the verse is caused by tbe e'ctus coming on the

’ , first syllable of perpetuum, while the accent is onthe second ,

Ad mea Ι perpetirlum ΙΙ ἀεΙόῖιεῖῖέ Ι tempora Ι carmen.

These directions would be sufficient for all or nearly all cases*
if it were not for the frequent elision· of the last syllable of words ι
viz„ in general, whenever a word ending in a vowel or in m is
followed by a word beginning with a vowel or wille h. This
makes the commonest and most annoying of the obstacles to be
met, and requires the beginner to 'be constantly on the watch. If
he will now carefully compare the following lines, as metrically
divided, with the rules which have been given above, it is ‘hoped
that he will haye little¹ difficultyghereafterf Ι - ι,

* It will be obseryed thar, of thelirst twentyverses of the poem, only the oth and rsth
lacu the caesura in the third font: while iu the roth, rath, and roth the principat pause is
in the fourth foot instead of the third. '
