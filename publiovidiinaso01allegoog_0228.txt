Acnrsws, king oi Argos, had been warned that he should be
dethroned and slain by'the child of his daughter Danae, whom
therefore, to elude the oracle, he confined'in a dungeon with brazen
walls. But Jupiter gained admission in the form of a shower of
gold, and Danae¹ became the mother of Perseus. Being shut with
the child - then four years os age—in a obest, or suffer, and cast
into the sea, she dristed to the island of Seriphus, where the boy
grew up, and was sent crastily by the tyrant os the island sor the
head oi the Gorgon Medusa. ln this enterprise he was helped
and delivered by the friendly car'e oi the divinities Mercury and
Minerva, who 'armed him sor his task, gave him the power oi ssight,
and made him invulnerable aud invincible. (See, for an admirable
