(Bostonr Ginn Brothers. litlot-This volumeis in keeping with the high
character of the editors' previous publicatione. It is not too much to say,
that with the appearance ol their “Latin Grammar,'' in 18⁷2, began a nevr
era in the study of the Latin languago in America, and perhaps there is no
more encouraging token ol the condition of classical scholarship among ns
than the cordial and intelligent welcome so generally utended to this ad·
vauced manual. Their edition ol “ Selected Oratione oi Cicero ” in 1873
was superior to any which the American student had before had. Δ prac-
ticel application oi tho hest results of Latin scholarship and of general
philology, and a clear conciseness of statement, pre-eminently characterized
both works, and these are the qualities which give to this edition of Virgil
its great merit. The wealth of comment which has accumulated about the
language and thoughts oi their author the editors seem to have thomnghly
examincd, without, however, sacrificing a practical and independcnt spirit
peculias to themselves. Wherever a diligent leamer would be likely to
have doubts as to Virgil’s exact meaning, or to be puzzled by the idioms or
subtletiee oi the Latin, there the editors appear with ample help, or, at least,
withaclue to the solution. We have been particularly pleased with the
synopses of thought which precede and accompany each portion of the
poema.

We are using Allen and Greenough's Latin Grammar, and find it ample
in amount, clear in statement and arrangement, suggestive of higber studies
in the same field, aad easy to cite-in short, an excellent school grammar.

We hare used Allen aad Greenoagh's Latin Grammar during the past
year with great satisfaction. It ansvers excellently all the purpoees of a
school-book, and furnishes much matter not previously accessible to most
pupils. It seems to me to mark adecided advaneein Philology, and to
meet well all the wants ol our preparatory schoola
