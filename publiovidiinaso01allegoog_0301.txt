Gerasenorum-ln scknowlcdging the reeeipt hom you oie copy oi Allan
and Greenongh's Virgil, allow mo to express my apprecietion of its supe·
rior merita es e text-book. I have been particularly plcesed with theIntro-
ductione ιο tho Buoolios and the AEueid, and the good judgmeut und rasta
exhibited in the notes, which in their rendering of many passages so well.
illustrate what the editors themselves recall sothe attention of the pupil,
that in translating, poetry requires “ ο more precise, virid, end pictoresque
use oi words then prose.''

cure. Ιι seems to be a worthy volume of the beautiful series of classice
which you are giving to American studente. The historica} notes end
explanations of technical points are excollent, and so clccr ns to be easily
remembered. I propose ιο use the book with my next Cicero pupils.
