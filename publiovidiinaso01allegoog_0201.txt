NOTES.

-ΙιιΗ-ι-

lr is supposed that most classes who read Ovid at all, will read
Ovid before any other Latin poet3 and as it is desirable that a
poetical composition should always be read as verse, -that is, with
a knowledge of its rhythmical structure-at few directions will
here be given for scanning at sight, or by ear, which, with a little
practice, will be found an easy, almost mechanical process.

It is necessary, first, for the learner to understand the nature
of the verse, as depending on precisely the same principles as the
rhythmical divisions of a piece of music (ᾗ 77); also, to be familiar
with the general rules of Quantity and Acuent (ξς 3, 4).’l Besides
this, the teacher should explain and illustrate, so far as may be
necessary, the structure of the hexameter (§ 82, a), reading from
the textos the poem itself, until its peculiar movement has become
familiar to the learner‘s ear. It will now be obser-ved·—

t. That the difficulties in scanning lie almost entirely in the

Ῐ first half os tlte verse. With very rare exceptions, the last two

feet, and generally the last three, are accented in verse exactly as .
they would be in prose: that is, the Arsit (first syllable) of the
foot corresponds with the natural or prose acc'ent of the word.

2. 'lhat in hexameter verse tlte third soot (rarely the fourth ¹
instead) regularly tegens wate tue last syllable osa wora chus,
while the last half of a verse is almost always accented as in prose, ³
the first half very seldom is. The slight pause interrupting the
foot at the end of the word is called a coesural pause (§¹19, ς);

and is the most important point that distinguishes the movement ·

of verse from that of prose. The pause in the third foot (less
commonly the fourth) usually corresponds with a pause in the
sense, andis called the principal caesura.

3. That whenever a short syllable occurs in the verse, there

must be a dacpl. This becomes a most ‘convenient mle, as soon
as the pronunciation of even the commonest words is known, in

‘To these it may be well to add the quantity of final syllables (ς 78, al. The
learner should alubebzbltuatedto an occuram pronunciation of words aoemdingto their
