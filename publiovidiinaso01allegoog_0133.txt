[As the chiefs marvel at this prodigy‚ Nestor relates of Caeneus,
once a maiden (Caenis), but made into an invulnerahle man, who
was present when the nuptial feast of Pirithous and Hippodamia
was disturhed hythe battle of the Lapithae and the Centaurs. For
the Centaurs, monsters of vast strength and fury, half-man, half-
horse‚ had attempted to steal away the bride. And Caeneus,
remaining unhurt through the fight, was at length overwhelmed
with vast piles of trees, and transformed hy Neptune to an eagle
(Xll. 146-535). The son of Hercules, Tlepolemus, tells also of
Periclymenus, slain by Hercules as he flew against him in the form
of an eagle (536-579). At the request of Neptune, whose son
Cygnus had been slain, Apollo guides the arrow of Paris to the
vulnerable heel of Achilles; so that he dies, and a strife arises
among the other chiefs who shall receive his armor‚ the rival
claimants being Ajax and Ulysses (580-628).]

Ajax maintains his claim, before the assembled chiefs, first as of
nobler descent, and then by his martial exploits, chiefly the defence
of the Grecian fleet; at the same time scorning the strategy of
Ulysses, and asserting that himself alone has might to wield the
immortal armour (1-122). To which Ulysses replies, that his own

counsel had been most effective in the siege, and his own acts most Ι

essential, especially in the night attach of the tents of Rhesus, and

the carrying away of the Palladium (123-381). To him the victory ’
is judged; and Ajax, in ungovemable math, slays himself with
his own sword,-the flower hyacinth springing from his blood
