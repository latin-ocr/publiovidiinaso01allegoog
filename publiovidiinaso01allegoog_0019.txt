With the primitive (fetichistic) notion of a separate lite in
every object, and the human soul differing in no essentiari regard
irom the iiie that dwelle in things, it was easy to imagine the spirit

' oi man, beast, or plant as passing hom one dwelling to another, ior

alongcr or shorrer stay. Such a transmigmtion was, in incr,
taught as a crced hythe school of Pythagoras (see Metam. xv.
1-487). But, as against the Hindoo doctrine oi transmigration
into che very liic oi other animale, the Greelm held to the identity
anri continuiiy oi the human snul, which aher death had its abode
assigned in the coner World. The metamorphosis, therefore,
is only an occasional miracle, not a real metempsychosis;† it did
not aiter essentially the ordinary course oi human iiie, but only
marked the intimate connection between that and the liic oi
external nature3 or, in a certain wild, pictorial way, showed the
workings oi human fancy, to account ior the first crection of plante
and animale, or other striking phenomena of the natural world, -a
clear water-spring ina little island (Arethusa), a mountain ridge
oi peculiar shape (Atlas), a bird oi plaintive note (Philomela), or
arnolt weeping with perpetual springs (thbe).
