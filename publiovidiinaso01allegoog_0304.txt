Messes. Grun Bnorrrans:

Geurceuun,-Haviug used Goodwin’s Greek Grammar, end Allan aad
Greenough's Latin Grammar, published by you, 1 take pleasure in bearing
testimony to their superior merits as school books. For class instruction
they have, iu my opinion, no equals. All the necessary facts and principles
of the Latin and Greek Languages aro stated and illustrated so plainly and
clearly, yet in so brirff u cumpasS, that studente will find everything easy of
comprehension and applicatiou, and be reliered from the nnnecessary detail
found iu many school grammius.

The “Latin aud Greek Lessons,” by Prof. Leighton, are excellent corn-
panions of these grammars, aud will be found runtaining all thetis neces-
sary ιο prepare a student to read Cesar or Xenophon with esse. I find
the other books of your Latin and Greek series, namely, Goodyrin’a Greek
Reader, Allen's Latin composition, Allen aud Greenough's Latin Selec-
tions and Cicero, exhibiting all the accurate scholarship and thorough adap-
tation to school work which we should expect from their distinguished
authors.

hs publishers, you deserve not only great eredit for the judgmcnt you
have displayed in the selection of your editorial corps, but also in the occu·
racy of the printing, and the general character of the mechanical work.

Messes. thn Bnornars:

Gauranum-For more thantwo years we bare used Allen and Green-
ough’s Latin Grammar and Leighton’s Latin Lessons with perfect satisfac-
tion. Before subjecting the grammar to the test of daily class use I was
greatly ples-sed with the evidence ol -ripe scholarship and familiarity with
latest results of philological researcb which it everywhere exhibitcd. Since
then three large classes heve brought out its excellencies in detail. The
Lessons by Mr. Leigbton shovy his tull comprehension of the qualities of
tha Grammar as well as the wants of beginners in the noble Latin tongue.
