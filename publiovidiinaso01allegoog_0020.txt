is apparently the first attempt of human thought to deal systemati-
cally with the phenomena of nature-so as, in a manner, to
account for things—before men were sufficiently free from super·
stition to reject the early fables. The titles of several Greek works
of the same kindare known ; and virgil, in the Sixth Eclogue,
puts a similar song into the mouth of Silenus. ,

Any thing like a real belief in these fables had passed away long
before the time of Ovid. He was the popular poet of a sensual
and artificia] age, who found in these creations of ancient fancy
a group of subjects suited tobis gracehrl, ornate, and marvellously
. facile style os narrative, and wbo did not hesitate to alteror dress
them up to suit his purpose. The “ Metamorphoses ’' —Libn' xv..
Metamorphoreon (a Greek genitive)—is the most abundant aud:
rich collection of these fables that exists. They are told in a
diffuse, sentimental, often debased way, which contrasts strongly
with the serious meaning that originally belonged to tbese myths 3·
but are wonderfully fluent, easy, and melodious in their language, and
show a skill of versification which seems never to halt or weary.·
The poem begins with the first origin of things from chaos, the.
four ages of gold, silver, bross, and iron, the deloge‚ followed by the

graceful and pictoresque version of tbe tales of gods and heroes,¹ ⁸

through a long narrative-about 12‚ooo verses in alh-ending.
with the apotheosis of Caesar, as the sequel of the tale of Troy.
The ser-ies purports to be chronologica13 but tbe order is often
arbi trary and the connection forced or affected, as would naturally
be the case withan author res donersnsimas inspeciem unius
corporis colligentem (Quint. iv. 1, 77).

The mythology of Ovid and the other Roman poets was Greek
mythology dressed up in Roman names. lt is not necessary to
remind the reader that the stories here told related to Zeus,
Athene, Artemis, and the other members of the Greek* Olympus,
and could never have been attributed to the sober abstractions of
the Roman Pantheon. Nevertheless‚ in commenting upoh Ovio,
it is impossible to avoid making use of the names in tbe same
sense that he did—the names long familiar in modern litera-
ture, which took them from the Romans and not the Greeks.
